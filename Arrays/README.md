#  Arrays

    Array is collection of data of same type in continous memory block
    Array have fixed size.
    Array element is access by its index starting from 0 to len-1

# Advantage
    Array stored collection of data of same type under one name
    Random access of element at any position is faster
    Array have local cache locality which big difference in performance.

# Disadvantage

    Array is of fixed size cant changed size after defined
    Array insertiong and deletion is costly as stored in contionuos memory block
    implementation of other data structure using array have some obvious flaw. (wastage of memory in stack)
