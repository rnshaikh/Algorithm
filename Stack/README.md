# Stack

    stack is linear data structure which store element in FILO order
    element which push first come out last
    we can perform push, pop, isEmpty, peek opration stack
    all operation are perform in o(1) time complexity


# Applications

    Balancing of symbols
    Infix to Postfix /Prefix conversion
    Redo-undo features at many places like editors, photoshop.
    Forward and backward feature in web browsers
    Used in many algorithms like Tower of Hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problem, histogram problem.
    Backtracking is one of the algorithm designing technique .Some example of back tracking are Knight-Tour problem,N-Queen problem,
    computer memory management



# implementation
    stack is implement throuh array and linkelist
