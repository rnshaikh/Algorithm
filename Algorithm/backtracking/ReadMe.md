# Backtacking:

    Backtracking is an algorithmic-design for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally,
    one piece at a time,
    removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time .
    ex. N-queen, permution of string, combination of characters of mobile digits.


    Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic design that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem.


    There are three types of problems in backtracking –

        Decision Problem – In this, we search for a feasible solution.
        Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the best solution.
        Enumeration Problem – In this, we find all feasible solutions.
