You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. 
The jugs donâ€™t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. 
You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. 
Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:

Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.
