    Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

    in dynamic progamming

        dp [i] = 1 + dp[i-offset]  where offset is highest of 2 which == i

        offset = 1

        for i = 2
        2*offset == i
        then offset = i



If we observe bits from rightmost side at distance i than bits get inverted after 2^i position in vertical sequence.
for example n = 5;
0 = 0000
1 = 0001
2 = 0010
3 = 0011
4 = 0100
5 = 0101
Observe the right most bit (i = 0) the bits get flipped after (2^0 = 1)
Observe the 3rd rightmost bit (i = 2) the bits get flipped after (2^2 = 4)
So, We can count bits in vertical fashion such that at iâ€™th right most position bits will be get flipped after 2^i iteration;
