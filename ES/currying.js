/*Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

Currying doesn’t call a function. It just transforms it.

Let’s see an example first, to better understand what we’re talking about, and then practical applications.

We’ll create a helper function curry(f) that performs currying for a two-argument f. 
In other words, curry(f) for two-argument f(a, b) translates it into a function that runs as f(a)(b):
*/


function curry(f) { // curry(f) does the currying transform
    return function(a) {
      return function(b) {
        return f(a, b);
      };
    };
  }
  
  // usage
  function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  
  let curriedSum = curry(sum);
  
  alert( curriedSum(1)(2) ); // 3
