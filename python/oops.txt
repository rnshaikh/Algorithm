procedural progmamming : in procedural progmamming we write code in terms of functions as basic unit.
object oriented programming : in object oriented progmamming we write code in terms of object 
which contain related data member, member function

oops pillars:
    there are four pillars to oops 
    1) abstraction : it means showing only essential details to users and hiding trivial or non essential detail.
                     ex. driver only know about acclerator and break button not its implementation. 
    2) Encapsulation : it means wrapping up related data member and member function into single unit called class.
                       so that data is protected from outside world. it is also call data hiding.
    3) Inheritance: it provide code reusability feature. it means extending data member and member function of parent class into 
                    new childern class.
                    1) single Inheritance: once child class extends from one parent class
                    3) hiearchial Inheritance : it represent grandparent, parent, child kind of relation
                    4) multiple Inheritance: once child class extends from more than one parent class 
    4) polymorphism : it means having many form. same function perfom different types of operation on different data.
                      1) static polymorphism: it is nothing but method overloading where method name in is same but its
                      signature is different. it differ in paremeter or return types
                      2) dynamic polymorphism: it is nothing but method overiding in inheritance where we override 
                      parent class function in childern class.
